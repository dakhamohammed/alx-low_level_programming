# C - Hello, World: ALX SE Africa.
## This is a starting point of learning C programming language the aim of this project is to learn what is the entry point, basic built in function like puts, printf, putchar and the compiler **gcc**.

### In this README you can find what each Shell script and C program do when you execute them in your Terminal.

1. 0-preprocessor
   - Shell script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable **$CFILE**
     - The output should be saved in the file c

2. 1-compiler
   - Shell script that compiles a C file but does not link.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable **$CFILE**
     - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
       - Example: if the C file is **main.c**, the output file should be **main.o**

3. 2-assembler
   - Shell script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable **$CFILE**
     - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
       - Example: if the C file is **main.c**, the output file should be **main.s**
