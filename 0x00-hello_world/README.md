# C - Hello, World: ALX SE Africa.
## This is a starting point of learning C programming language the aim of this project is to learn what is the entry point, basic built in function like puts, printf, putchar and the compiler **gcc**.

### In this README you can find what each Shell script and C program do when you execute them in your Terminal.

1. 0-preprocessor
   - Shell script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable **$CFILE**
     - The output should be saved in the file c

2. 1-compiler
   - Shell script that compiles a C file but does not link.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable **$CFILE**
     - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
       - Example: if the C file is **main.c**, the output file should be **main.o**

3. 2-assembler
   - Shell script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable **$CFILE**
     - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
       - Example: if the C file is **main.c**, the output file should be **main.s**

4. 3-name
   - Shell script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named **cisfun**.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable **$CFILE**

5. 4-puts.c
   - C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle.

6. 5-printf.c
   - C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,


7. 6-size.c
   - C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
     - You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option

8. 100-intel
   - Shell script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
     - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
