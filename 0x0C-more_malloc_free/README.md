   - Function that allocates memory using malloc.
     - Returns a pointer to the allocated memory
     - if malloc fails, the malloc_checked function should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98.

2. 1-string_nconcat.c
   - Function that concatenates two strings.
     - The returned pointer shall point to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains s1, followed by the first n bytes of s2, and null terminated.
     - If n is greater or equal to the length of s2 then use the entire string s2.
