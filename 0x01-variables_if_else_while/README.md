# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

1. 0-positive_or_negative.c
   - C program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
     - The output of the program should be:
       - The number, followed by
         - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
         - if the number is 0: is zero
         - if the number is less than 0: is negative

2. 1-last_digit.c
   - C program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
     - The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
     - The output of the program should be:
       - The string Last digit of, followed by
       - n, followed by
       - the string is, followed by
         - if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
         - if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
         - if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

3. 2-print_alphabet.c
   - C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.

4. 3-print_alphabets.c
   - C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase.

5. 4-print_alphabt.c
   - C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
     - Print all letters except e and q

6. 5-print_numbers.c

   - C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

10. 9-print_comb.c
    - C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
      - Numbers separated by , and white-space

11. 100-print_comb3.c
    - C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

12. 101-print_comb4.c
    - C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

13. 102-print_comb5.c
    - C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
      - The numbers should range from 0 to 99
      - The two numbers should be separated by a space
      - All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
      - 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
